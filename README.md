# Swatch Exchange
Although there are already some great resources online for viewing pigment swatches such as [artistpigments.org](https://artistpigments.org/), there isn't one that allows users to upload their own swatches that can be viewed and rated for accuracy by other users.
Any artist will tell you that a pigment's appearance and properties differ greatly depending on the medium and the surface they are being used on.
